This is a time series analysis project. 
In this project, I forecast for Tesla Stock Price based on historical data downloaded from Investing.com.
This project contains 4 parts: Data Preparation, Technical Analysis, Modeling and Model Performance.
This project used Shiller, Io-Mackinlay, and Facebook Prophet to forecast and used 3 metrics: MAPE, RMSE and R2 score to evaluate each model performance.
